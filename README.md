- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aman-Randhawa
- 👀 I’m a software developer with more than 3 years’ experience in building digital solutions for commercial world.
- Over the years, I’ve worked with Domino's Pizza Enterprises Ltd (Domino's), applying interactive and visual design principles on website and web application for a positive and cohesive user experience.
  I’m comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, VWO, Jira, Confluence, React, Node.js.NET, SQL and I am using Agile and scrum methodologies to keep projects running smoothly. I also have experience with C#, C++, Python and     cloud platforms like GITHUB.
  My real strength is problem-solving—whether that means fixing bugs or breaking things (in a good way) to find better solutions.​
  Above all, I value collaboration and co –ordination among teams to deliver results.
